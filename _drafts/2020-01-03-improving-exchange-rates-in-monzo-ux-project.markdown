## Summary

A new international transfers feature designed to help novice users understand exchange rates. Affinity mapping from user research highlighted that novice users find international transfers frustrating, and donâ€™t get sufficient feedback. We used a Design Studio and Rapid Decision Jam to agree on our solution, and Feature Prioritisation to build and iterate a minimum viable product. I facilitated many of the workshops including standups and retrospectives, and designed the mid-fidelity prototype ensuring it used symbols, text and layer styles to help the team move to high-fidelity. I implemented Abstract to enable the team to simultaneously work on and track changes to our Sketch files.
