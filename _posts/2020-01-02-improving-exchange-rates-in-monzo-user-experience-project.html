					<h2>The Brief:</h2>
					<p>General Assembly briefed us on a concept project for Monzo. The task was to find a way to improve international transfers by bringing them into Monzo. We needed to ensure we did so in a way that would benefit users and also find a competitive advantage.</p>

		<h2>The Solution</h2>

		<p>A new exchange rates feature designed to help users know when to make transfers, and to help novice users (including those with dyslexia and dyspraxia) understand exchange rates.</p>

		<p>It includes:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>An onboarding journey to educate users</li>
			<li>An exchange rates screen that provides users with information to make informed decisions about </li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Summary</h2>

		<p>
			During interviews my client said that he would potentially double his travel time to avoid congestion. In testing it was also apparent that other people would like to avoid congestion. However this does not gurantee that users would take journeys if it involved leaving earlier, or extending their travel time. 
		</p>

		<p>- it was difficult to know the right amount of information to show people and what to say</p>

		<p>- other stuff</p>
