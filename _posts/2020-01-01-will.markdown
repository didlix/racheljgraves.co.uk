Congested travel is difficult for people with anxiety, there aren't apps out there to help them.

## Project Summary 
* _Role:_ Lead UX Designer
* _Team Size:_ 1
* _Length of project:_ 1 week sprint


## What

Will is deeply upset by congestion when travelling by the underground. He would like to avoid it but isn’t able to with the apps that he uses. Will would go so far as to double his journey time to avoid the congestion encountered while commuting.


## How & Why

### Method

This project took plce over a few days and followed a single iteration of the  UX Double Diamond process.

In this process I used the following techniques.

* Semi-Structured Interview
* User Journey
* Storyboard
* Task Analysis
* Experience Map
* Sketched Design Ideas
* Paper Prototype
* Marvel Prototype

This project was broken into three stages , Research, Design and Testing. Research consisted of a Semi-Structured Interview with the client and  Analysis of that interview. I produced a User Journey, Storyboard and Task Analysis which I combined into an Experience Map to communicate the problem and help put myself contextually in Will’s shoes. Using these communication tools I sketched six design ideas that provided solutions from different angles. I did not want to limit myself to only one approach to the problem. I showed these designs to Will to gauge his feelings about them, and measured the practicality of each. I decided that a mobile app would be the correct balance of achievable and useful. ...  After user testing was concluded I refined my design further into a digital prototype which was tested again.

#### User Interview

A semi-structured interview was conducted with will to find out more about his travel concerns. I learned that Will is extremely bothered by crowds and would prefer to avoid them if empowered to do so. He is keen to always be on time yet finds tube travel unreliable due to delays. He has very little trust in the information given to him about delays and gives it no attention.

_“I would rather take twice as long to not be in a completely rammed carriage where you can't even breathe.”_

* Analysis
* Key findings
* Follow up interview

### Problem Statement

_Will needs a way to travel by routes low in congestion._

_Because he finds crowds uncomfortable._


### Storyboard

A storyboard was really useful as a way to show Will's journey in context. Having a visual representaiton clearly shows how congestion affects Will.

### User Journey

From my interview with Will I was able to produce materials to communicate his problem. I produced a User Journey, Task Analysis and Storyboard. Using these materials I spoke to Will again and was able to map his emotions as he goes through his commute from planning, to arriving at his location. I combined all of this barring the storyboard into an experience map seen below. I found the storyboard useful for placing myself in context with his surroundings as he performed his task, but did not feel it was necessary to include it in my presentation deck or this case study.
