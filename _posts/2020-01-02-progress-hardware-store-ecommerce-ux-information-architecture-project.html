			<h2>Opportunity</h2>
			<p>Improve the shopping experience for online hardware stores.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>User research, contextual enquiry and card sorting informed a minimalist design with simple product categories. Visual design centred around helping users use their imagination to help them imagine products in their lives.</p>

			<h2>The Problem</h2>

			<p>User research showed that people are overwhelmed by the amount of categories and products on hardware e-commerce sites. Furthermore, they like to use their imagination when shopping and found that the images used on stores did not aid this.</p>

			<h2>The Solution</h2>

			<p>An e-commerce site with a very simple navigation. Similar products like paints available in different sizes and colours have been grouped together to reduce the amount of information presented to the user.</p>

			<p>It includes:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Multiple tested user flows with changes made based on testing.</li>
				<li>Simple product categories that were designed and tested from open and closed card sorts.</li>
				<li>A style guide centred around making products seem more tactile, and beautiful to help users invoke their imagination and connect to products when shopping.</li>
			</ul>
