					<h2>The Brief:</h2>
					<p>The needs of LGBTQIA* people are often not met, information is hard to find, and sometimes even "offensive and discriminatory".</p>
					<p>I chose this as a topic for an Information Architecture project during my time at City University.

			<h2>The Solution</h2>

			<p>A website powered by search that enables LGBTQIA* people to find health services. This journey focuses on how users will find the information and how it will be displaed.</p>

			<p>Careful attention was paid to information received from a LGBTQIA* healthcare proffesional during an interview with them. They reported that poor reviews for services on NHS.uk persist and disuade people from attending to their health needs. These reviews have often been addressed by the practice, but persist and continue to disuade potential patients. In this initial version reviews have been left off, however other ways to deal with it could be explored</p>

		<div class="-col">
			<p>It includes:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>A storyboard depicting how search will work.</li>
				<li>Wireframes for the homepage and the display of information.</li>
				<li>A sitemap.</li>
				<li>A domain model to describe the relationship of information handled by the site.</li>
				<li>An academic report with justifications for decisions were made.</li>
				<li>Online usability testing using <em>ChalkMark</em> by Optimal Workshops.</li>
