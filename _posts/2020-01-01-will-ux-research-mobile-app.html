					<p>General Assembly asked me to interview my classmate Will about Travel. It was my job to identify pain points in his experience and then ideate and prototype a solution to solve those paints.</p>

					<p>Will is deeply upset by congestion when travelling by the underground. He would like to avoid it but isn’t able to with the apps that he uses. Will would go so far as to double his journey time to avoid the congestion encountered while commuting.</p>

					<p>Delays frequently occur during Will's comute. He doesn't have faith in the existing tools to inform him about those delays and how best to avoid the congestion that ensnares.</p>

		<h2>The Solution</h2>

		<p>A mobile application was designed and tested during a one week sprint. It empowers users to plan their journeys around congestion levels on the tube.</p>

		<p>It includes:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Experience maps and Storyboards to communicate the problem</li>
			<li>A clickable paper prototype built in InVision</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Summary</h2>

		<p>This project effectively demonstrated the benefits of using low cost and fast methods of design to test ideas. By using paper prototypes I was able to quickly get feedback on the feasability of my proposed solution. Early testing also afforded the opportunity to make usability improvements. </p>

		<p>Using a storyboard was an effective way to put Will's journey in a context easier to emphathise with. Being able to show people Will's journey helped remove people's own biases from their own imaginations.</p>

		<p>The next steps for this project would be to test the concept with real people taking real journeys. During interviews my client said that he would potentially double his travel time to avoid congestion. This would need to be tested in order to know if people would make these choices. </p>

		<p>This prototype didn't address Will's lack of information about delays to his journey. An additional sprint would provide the opportunity to ideate a solution.</p>
