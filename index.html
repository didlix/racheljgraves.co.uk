				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I am a User Experience Designer based in London and have worked in technology for over a decade.  Before moving into User Experience I worked as a Software Engineer and Systems Administrator. I have worked at a number of brands and companies, including Babylon Health, the Money Advice Service, Dachis Group and Comic Relief.
				</p>
				<p>
					My interest is  in products that promote better standards of living, health and wellbeing, through healthcare, government or finance. I advocate for inclusive research and design and believe that designing for people of all backgrounds and abilities helps produce better products for everyone. I am queer, transgender and have a hidden disability so I understand the importance through my lived experiences.
